      <description>We live-streamed a world class first episode of OpenHW TV on 18th June and even exceeded our registration numbers, as guest presenters from Metrics and Imperas highlighted the open source CORE-V processor IP design verification plan. Our live Q&amp;amp;A session at the end with panellists from OpenHW Group including the Co-Chairs of our Verification Task Group was extremely popular and provoked some great discussion.

      <description>We’re excited to announce our latest initiative to help us amplify the value of open source processor IP – OpenHWTV. It’s a series of online events that look at the barriers to adoption of opensource IP and in each episode, we delve a little deeper into different areas with help from our 45+ members.
In the first episode, which airs on 18th June @ 11am EST, we look at the importance of verification with guest presenters from Imperas, a leader in virtual platforms and high-performance software simulation and Metrics, the first true cloud-based platformfor ASIC and complex FPGA design verification.</description>
