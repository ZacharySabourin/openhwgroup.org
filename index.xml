      <description>Back in June, the first episode of OpenHW TV looked at the CORE-V Verification Test Bench and our open-source RISC-V processor IP design verification plan. Just 4 months on and OpenHW Group is approaching the Functional RTL Freeze milestone for the CVE4. This episode looks at what the Functional RTL Freeze milestone means and how learnings from our early verification efforts have shaped our test bench progress, highlighting bugs and coverage gaps to help us deliver commercial grade, industrial quality verification work.</description>

      <description>Episode 4 discusses the OpenHW Group philosophy of learn, adopt, produce: learning about what is available in open-source ecoysystems, adopting and gaining experience on using these building blocks and deploying commercial grade open-source elements in production releases of designs. The episode includes updates from the OpenHW Group HW Task Group discussing the CORE-V MCU SoC project and features speakers from QuickLogic giving an overview of the ETH Zurich &amp;ldquo;Arnold&amp;rdquo; test chip and the path to production for the CORE-V MCU SoC, as well as Global Foundries talking about the features and benefits of 22FDX.</description>

      <description>We’re excited to announce our latest initiative to help us amplify the value of open source processor IP – OpenHWTV. It’s a series of online events that look at the barriers to adoption of opensource IP and in each episode, we delve a little deeper into different areas with help from our 45+ members.
In the first episode, which airs on 18th June @ 11am EST, we look at the importance of verification with guest presenters from Imperas, a leader in virtual platforms and high-performance software simulation and Metrics, the first true cloud-based platformfor ASIC and complex FPGA design verification.</description>
