Examples include, but are not limited to, Eclipse IoT sandbox servers, the User Storage Service, and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative.

<p>If Content is licensed to you under the terms and conditions of a version of the Eclipse Public License (&rdquo;<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0" target="_blank">EPL</a>&rdquo;), with respect to such Content, the term “Contributions” as used herein shall have the meaning provided in the EPL, and any such Contributions uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the EPL and can be made available to others under the terms of the EPL.</p>

<p>If Content is licensed to you under license terms and conditions other than the EPL (&ldquo;Other License&rdquo;) with respect to such Content the term “Contributions “ as used herein shall mean any modifications, enhancements and/or other code and/or documentation related to such Content uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, and such Contributions shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the Other License.

For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation details of how the Eclipse project code or your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provide above would not cover such additional material.</p>
