      <description>Episode 4 discusses the OpenHW Group philosophy of learn, adopt, produce: learning about what is available in open-source ecoysystems, adopting and gaining experience on using these building blocks and deploying commercial grade open-source elements in production releases of designs. The episode includes updates from the OpenHW Group HW Task Group discussing the CORE-V MCU SoC project and features speakers from QuickLogic giving an overview of the ETH Zurich &amp;ldquo;Arnold&amp;rdquo; test chip and the path to production for the CORE-V MCU SoC, as well as Global Foundries talking about the features and benefits of 22FDX.</description>

      <description>Episode 03 features our HW and SW Task Groups, as well as guest member Ashling. The Chairs of the groups talk about the work of the SW and HW Task Groups to date, including an outlook to future roadmaps. We also look in detail at the open source GNU toolchain for the CORE-V family of RISC-V cores provided by Embecosm, and Ashling presents an in-depth overview and live demonstration of the RiscFree Eclipse based IDE debug interface to the Genesys2 FPGA board.</description>

      <description>We live-streamed a world class first episode of OpenHW TV on 18th June and even exceeded our registration numbers, as guest presenters from Metrics and Imperas highlighted the open source CORE-V processor IP design verification plan. Our live Q&amp;amp;A session at the end with panellists from OpenHW Group including the Co-Chairs of our Verification Task Group was extremely popular and provoked some great discussion.
