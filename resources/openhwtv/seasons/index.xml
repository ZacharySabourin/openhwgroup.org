      <description>OpenHW TV S01E03CORE V SW and HW in the FPGA environment Aug 26, 2020
 Episode 03 features our HW and SW Task Groups, as well as guest member Ashling. The Chairs of the groups talk about the work of the SW and HW Task Groups to date, including an outlook to future roadmaps. We also look in detail at the open source GNU toolchain for the CORE-V family of RISC-V cores provided by Embecosm, and Ashling presents an in-depth overview and live demonstration of the RiscFree Eclipse based IDE debug interface to the Genesys2 FPGA board.</description>
