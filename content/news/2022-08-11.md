Did you miss out on Embedded World in Nuremburg, Germany in June? This episode of OpenHW TV will give you another chance to view OpenHW Group's live presentation and hear all of the details on the new CORE-V MCU DevKit! OpenHW Group and its members announced one of the industry’s most comprehensive open-source RISC-V Development Kits at Embedded World 2022. The CORE-V MCU DevKit features the OpenHW CORE-V MCU, the CORE-V software developer kit (SDK) with full-featured Eclipse-integrated development environment (IDE) and an open printed circuit board (PCB) design that supports AWS via AWS IoT ExpressLink. The ground-breaking RISC-V-based CORE-V MCU DevKit enables software development for embedded, internet-of-things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications.
